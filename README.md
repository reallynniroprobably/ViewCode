# Viewcode

**A visual coding tool for actual programming languages.**

Viewcode is a locally hosted environment that allows users to build software visually using library-supported, syntax-compatible logic blocks. It compiles directly to standalone, optimized executables without runtime boilerplate.

## Features

*   **Visual Interface, Real Code:** Logic blocks map directly to standard programming languages.
*   **Native Compilation:** Generates distinct executables with no extra overhead.
*   **Library Support:** Import and utilize standard external libraries within the visual environment.
*   **Local Hosting:** Runs entirely on the local machine for security and offline capability.

## Roadmap

*   **[Phase 1]** [Description of goal, e.g., Alpha Release] - *[Target Date]*
*   **[Phase 2]** [Description of goal, e.g., Plugin System] - *[Target Date]*
*   **[Phase 3]** [Description of goal, e.g., v1.0 Launch] - *[Target Date]*

## Planned Features

*   [ ] [Feature Placeholder 1, e.g., C++ Support]
